## **About our App**
---
Using a heterogenous mix of open data, our application serves as a central hub for mental health services within central Toronto. It displays stylized symbols for each of the three urgency categories of a given service (*"Need Help","Need Support","Need Information"*). Additionally, it allows users to search services by urgency and available dates, find services in close proximity (within 5 km) to their current location, and provide shortest routes to a facility of a user's choice. Any other widgets or functionality that is unclear can **likely** be clarified with the How to Widget on the header.
