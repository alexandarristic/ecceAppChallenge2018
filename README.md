## **About our App**
Using a heterogenous mix of open data, our streamlined application serves as a centralized hub for mental health services within central Toronto. It displays stylized symbols for each of the three urgency categories of a given service (*"Need Help","Need Support","Need Information"*). Additionally, it allows users to search services by urgency and available dates, find services in close proximity (within 5 km) to their current location, rate the quality of their experience with a service (*using Survey123*) and provide shortest routes to a facility of a user's choice. Any other widgets or functionality which are unclear can **likely** be clarified with the How to Widget on the header.

## **App Inspiration**

This app was created to reduce the disparity in Toronto based mental health locators currently. As it stands no platform provides such detailed information, let alone filtering such information by urgency and providing valuable feedback for a service. This app seeks to empower the user to take positive steps toward achieving mental well-being and helping others in need. We hope that this application can be scaled to the provincial level, and even the national level in the future to extend our platform, mission and ideology.
